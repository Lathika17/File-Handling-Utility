*DESCRIPTION*: This Java File Handling Utility program demonstrates how to perform essential file operations such as writing, reading, appending, and modifying text files using the java.io package. Developed in the Eclipse IDE on a Windows platform, the application uses core classes like FileWriter, FileReader, BufferedReader, and BufferedWriter along with the Scanner class for user input. These tools allow the program to interact with files efficiently while handling exceptions safely. This type of file-handling functionality is widely used in real-world applications such as log management systems, local data storage tools, text editors, configuration file processing, and automation scripts. The project showcases fundamental concepts of Java I/O, making it useful for beginners, internships, and software systems that require reading or updating text-based data.
